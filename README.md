PROBLEM STATEMENT DETAILS

Category: Software + Hardware (IoT)

Domain: Embedded Development

Problem Statement Real-Time Voice Transfer and Human Speech Filter:

 1) Develop a real-time voice transfer system using two ESP32 boards.
 Connect two microphones to the first ESP32 and a speaker to the second
 ESP32 board. Implement a real-time voice transfer system between the two
 ESP32 boards. Utilize Bluetooth communication protocols for seamless
 data transfer. Minimize latency to achieve a smooth and real-time voice
 transfer experience.
 2) Design and Implement a Filter to selectively transmit only Human
 speech to the receiving ESP32. The filter should be designed to minimize
 background noise and focus on clear human voice
